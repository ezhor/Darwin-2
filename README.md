# Darwin 2
Darwin was the name of [a simulation I made](https://github.com/ezhor/Arensis) a few years ago in Javascript.
This is an improved version made in Unity3D and using [berds](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRei8TBpt4r0WPZ7MkiKmVg) as individuals.

Whenever two individuals touch, if they are in their fertile period, they reproduce and create another individual with mixed characteristics and a small random mutation.

Each individual has 4 characteristics expressed as physicial qualities:

Quantity of red: Speed.

Quantity of blue: Reproductive speed. The more blue in an individual, the less it has to wait after reproducing to be in a fertile period again.

Quantity of green: Life expectancy.

Size of the individual: Actual size.


All characteristics are proportional summing upt to 100 points.

For example:

10 points to speed.

40 points to life expectancy.

10 points to reproductive speed.

40 points to size.

(That would be a big and lasting animal, like an elephant)

40 points to speed.

10 points to life expectancy.

45 points to reproductive speed.

5 points to size.

(That would be a small and reproductively active animal, like a mouse)
